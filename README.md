# Holy Git!

Holy Git was developed with the intention of practicing the development of websites with ReactJS. I had this idea because I love websites that generate statistics from profiles on social networking sites and still did not know anyone who did this with the GitHub profile.

You can access the website [here](http://holy-git.com).

## Running the project

The project was made using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). To run the project locally, you can run the following commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/thiagodroz/holy-git.git
    $ cd holy-git/
    $ yarn install
    $ npm start

Now you can access the app at your localhost, port 3000.

## Commits

Any commits with the aim of improving the project will be welcome :)
